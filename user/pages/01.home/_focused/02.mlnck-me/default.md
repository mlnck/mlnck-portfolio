Over a dozen years in the industry, and I'm more passionate now than ever.

===

What else can I say?

In relationship to my years on the Earth I've been doing this a long time.
Basically 1/3 of my life has been devoted to development. And the difference is, when I say _devoted_, I mean, work 12 hours at the fulltime job, then come home and work until my eyes won't stay open with tutorials and snippets of the next skillset(s) that I want to pick up on run across the screen.

And (in a nutshell) that is the driving force behind this rebrand. Need to see a portfolio site, or one-off web design / implementation? No problem. I have more than I can count, and frankly, having to filter the ones to display is getting a bit tiresome.

>"So why aren't you showing us a site full of apps?"

Good question. And the main reason is:
\t`user.needs = money`

Until now, anytime I had a choice between doing a project that would benefit me in the long run, and doing a project that was relatively static (as far as career growth is concerned) I would choose the static project. I needed money, the family needed money, hell, who _doesn't_ need money!? (And if you find that person please tell them to reach out to me ... I have a ***_wonderful_*** business proposition for them)!

(Getting back on track), with the introduction of sites/apps such as [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com)  &amp; [Twich](http://www.twitch.tv) the decision to get paid workting for other people and getting paid working for myself is dwindling. I know it will not be a fast climb, but if I could achieve enough followers for Twitch to pay me to stream [at night]('/about') then I could justify working on the most up-to-date pieces of development, while hopefully giving an audience an entertaining block of accreude Knowledge.

With all of that out of the way I present to you _mlnck.me_ / _mlnck.com_. Part Blog, part portfolio, part think tank, all fun!.
Let's see how this plays out!

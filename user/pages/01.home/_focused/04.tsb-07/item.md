<p class="summary">A story written for worth 1000 ([http://www.worth1000.com](http://www.worth1000.com)) for a contest with the theme of "It Came From Outer Space"</p>

===

Neil Heaton didn't know that he had less than five seconds to live, nor did he know that (in essence) he had killed himself. All Neil knew at that moment was that he absolutely did not know what he was seeing.

Neil was leaning back, staring at a wavering green dot on his shirt, and uttering the most profound of statements ("What the fu-"), when a metal orb, about the size of a handball, slammed into his body. It was moving fast enough that Neil never saw the object that killed him. One instant, he was staring at a green light; the next, he could see straight through a hole that had appeared in his body (and he found himself looking at a small crater caused by the orb when it embedded itself into the ground behind him); and the next instant, he was dead.

What Neil would never know is exactly what happened to his body between that first and second instant. That a piece of metal had contacted his sternum, and simply pulverized the bone on its way through his body. The main organ it hit was his heart, and on impact the muscle was demolished. The sphere continued its fatal trek by barreling into Neil's spinal cord and ripping a section of the nerve (along with a few vertebrae) through the hole that was created as the orb exited his body.

As Neil collapsed, the box that he had bet his life on fell from his hand. The same box that Neil (if he was still alive) would have told you held the answer to all of his problems in life. Now, it was just a stolen piece of equipment lying next to a dead guy.

Neil was not the only dead guy in the area. And he was well aware of that fact before he died. Less than five miles from where he would take his last breath three others had taken theirs. Ironically, those three men had also died by metal projectiles ripping through their bodies. Neil knew of these bodies (of course he did) because he was the one that shot them in his quest for the box.

The same box that Neil had only heard about a week before his death. The box that, just hours after his death, would already have rumors circulating around it. Some would say that the box itself was possessed, that it had to be to be responsible for the deaths of four people only hours after it was completely assembled. Others would say that the three agents who died that day were haunting Neil and that they had activated the box. Of course, there were just as many employees of Homeland Security that thought the events leading up to the traitor's death were all a coincidence. And, being a rational organization, it was the last group's opinion that was reflected in the government's official write up.

A write up which would strip out all emotional attachment and feeling, and reveal as little as possible about the actual project details as it could while still reporting what it must. Then it would be passed around a table and read only by people who already knew about the project before it was put under lock and key for the "protection of the nation." And as these people received the paper they would only give it the most perfunctory of glances, after all, they already knew the whole story, including the details the report would omit.

The overview, although written with much more jargon and legalese, would state that a week before the completion of project TSB-07 (nicknamed SpaceBall by the engineers to try to add some levity to such a fatal weapon) Neil Heaton had stolen a key card that he used to determine the delivery route of the controller of the 2.5 billion dollar undertaking. It would briefly mention details of Neil's personal life, how his wife had left him, how he'd had to take out a second mortgage on his house due to gambling debts, and how the office ordered psychiatrist had ordered a prescription of anti-depressants that Neil had never filled. The report would stress that Neil knew no details of the project itself (which was evidenced by his actions). It would fail to mention that the overseers would be at risk of losing their jobs if word of the project had been leaked, and that in reality they had no way of knowing how much of the project's details Neil had known. The report continues to give a "best fit scenario" for what happened that day. That Neil had used a van to block the road in a desolate spot on the route the agents were taking. And, using a fully automatic assault rifle with armor piercing rounds, he attacked the vehicle transporting the TSB-07 Control Box; killing the agents within seconds. The report would state that how Neil obtained the weapon and ammunition was still "under investigation." When the killing was over Neil removed the Control Box from the car and in his haste he had armed and activated Satellite SB37-Q. Satellite SB37-Q was just one of the many weapon satellites in orbit over Earth for the project. When it received the signal from the controller it did exactly what it was built to do. It fired a spherical, metal object at the planet. In this object was a mini-fortune of fine tuned machinery. And what this machinery was responsible for was taking the information given to it and controlling the course the orb would take. The machinery was able to gather the information due to a green laser light that was aimed in front of the sphere, and originated from within. A light that (due to the high velocity, and slight course changes of the projectile) would appear to waver to anyone watching it from a stationary position. The death of Neil Harris was the first kill of the new wave of America's Space to Earth weapons, and to the Pentagon, confirmed the success of the project.
